/**
 * Picks the freshest of two tokens. Returns whichever argument has the more
 * recent claim freshness. On a full tie (same oiat AND same iat) it returns
 * `incoming`, since two tokens with identical timestamps can still differ in
 * other claims (azp, org_id, etc.) during a token-format rollout, so the
 * guard should only suppress when existing is strictly fresher.
 *
 * All origin-minted tokens carry the `oiat` JWT header (origin-issued-at;
 * timestamp when claims were last assembled from the DB). A token without
 * `oiat` is from a pre-feature codebase and is by definition staler than any
 * token that has one.
 *
 * Returns `incoming` when `existing` is null/undefined (no baseline yet), so a
 * caller with an optional baseline (a cache miss, a not-yet-set token) can pass
 * it straight through.
